Swishetest version 0.05
=======================

This is a module for testing Swish-e. Includes data and tests.

The tests are performed by first installing Swish-e and SWISH::API, then:
	* untarring the Swishetest.x.xx.tar.gz tarball
	* perl Makefile.PL
	* make && make test
	(this module is not intended to be installed at this point)

Swishetest.pm implements two functions which are simple interfaces
	to build and search on swishe indices : build_index() and do_search().	
	See perldoc Swishetest.pm for more.

In the t/ directory are the perl scripts that perform tests using Swishetest.
They're typically run via 'make test'
'make test TEST_VERBOSE=1' will give you more debug output,
'make test TEST_VERBOSE=2' will give you even more debug output (try it).

'make test MAX_INDEX_FILES=1000' will use only 1000 files in the test index

The tests in the t/ directory are named like
		010-C010-trivial-txt.t , that is
		[Test#]-[CollectionNumber]-[Description]-[type].t
	(Don't put hyphens ('-'s) in your Description.)

In the conf/ directory are swish-e configuration files used for the testing.
	The basic configurations so far are
		basic-libxml2.conf  and
		basic-nolibxml2.conf
	which each set .html, .xml, and .txt files to the appropriate parsers.
	More can be added.  (It would be good if users could specify all options from
	the command line and not have to use config files, perhaps through a
	-O switch that would act as if the text had been found in the config file:
	would be used like   % swish-e -O'IndexOnly .html' -i htmldir/ -f swish.index )

The blib/index/ directory is where the test indexes are deposited.  This way
they get cleaned up when you type 'make clean'
