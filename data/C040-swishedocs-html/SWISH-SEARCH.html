<P>
This page describes the process of searching with Swish-e. Please see the <A HREF="././SWISH-CONFIG.html">SWISH-CONFIG</A> page for information the Swish-e configuration file directives, and <A HREF="././SWISH-RUN.html">SWISH-RUN</A> for a complete list of command line arguments.

<P>
Searching a Swish-e index involves passing <A HREF="././SWISH-RUN.html">command line arguments</A> to it that specify the index file to use, and the <A HREF="#Searching_Syntax_and_Operations">query</A> (or search words) to locate in the index. Swish-e returns a list of file
names (or URLs) that contain the matched search words.  <A HREF="#Searching_with_Perl">Perl</A>
is often used as a front-end to Swish-e such as in CGI applications, and <A HREF="#Perl_Modules">perl modules</A> exist to for interfacing with Swish-e.

<P>
The <CODE>-w</CODE> command line argument is used specify the search query to Swish-e.

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
will find all documents that contain the word <STRONG>airplane</STRONG>.

<P>
When running Swish-e from a shell prompt, be careful to protect your query
from shell metacharacters and shell expansions. This often means placing
single or double quotes around your query. See <A HREF="#Searching_with_Perl">Searching with Perl</A> if you plan to use Perl as a front end to Swish-e. In the examples below
single quotes are used to protect the search from the shell.

<P>
The following section describes various aspects of searching with Swish-e.

<P>
[ <B><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="#toc">TOC</A></FONT></B> ]
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Boolean_Operators">Boolean Operators</A></H2>
<P>
You can use the Boolean operators <STRONG>and</STRONG>, <STRONG>or</STRONG> or <STRONG>not</STRONG> in searching. Without these Boolean operators Swish-e will assume you're <STRONG>and</STRONG>'ing the words together. The operators are not case sensitive. These three
searches are the same:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    swish-e -w foo bar
    swish-e -w bar foo
    swish-e -w foo AND bar</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
[Note: you can change the default to <STRONG>or</STRONG>ing by changing the variable DEFAULT_RULE in the config.h file and
recompiling Swish-e.]

<P>
The <STRONG>not</STRONG> operator inverts the results of a search.

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>   swish-e -w not foo</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
finds all the documents that do not contain the word foo.

<P>
Parentheses can be used to group searches.

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>   swish-e -w 'not (foo and bar)'</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
The result is all documents that have none or one term, but not both.

<P>
To search for the words <STRONG>and</STRONG>, <STRONG>or</STRONG>, or <STRONG>not</STRONG>, place them in a double quotes. Remember to protect the quotes from the
shell:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    swish-e -w '&quot;not&quot;'
    swish-e -w \&quot;not\&quot;</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
will search for the word &quot;not&quot;.

<P>
Other examples:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>     swish-e -w smilla or snow</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
Retrieves files containing either the words &quot;smilla&quot; or
&quot;snow&quot;.

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>     swish-e -w smilla snow not sense 
     swish-e -w '(smilla and snow) and not sense'  (same thing)</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
retrieves first the files that contain both the words &quot;smilla&quot;
and &quot;snow&quot;; then among those the ones that do not contain the
word &quot;sense&quot;.

<P>
[ <B><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="#toc">TOC</A></FONT></B> ]
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Truncation">Truncation</A></H2>
<P>
The wildcard (*) is available, however it can only be used at the end of a
word: otherwise is is considered a normal character (i.e. can be searched
for if included in the WordCharacters directive).

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>     swish-e -w librarian</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
this query only retrieves files which contain the given word.

<P>
On the other hand:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>     swish-e -w 'librarian*'</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
retrieves &quot;librarians&quot;, &quot;librarianship&quot;, etc. along
with &quot;librarian&quot;.

<P>
Note that wildcard searches combined with word stemming can lead to
unexpected results. If stemming is enabled, a search term with a wildcard
will be stemmed internally before searching. So searching for
<CODE>running*</CODE> will actually be a search for <CODE>run*</CODE>, so <CODE>running*</CODE> would find <CODE>runway</CODE>. Also, searching for <CODE>runn*</CODE> will not find <CODE>running</CODE>
as you might expect, since <CODE>running</CODE> stems to <CODE>run</CODE> in the index, and thus <CODE>runn*</CODE> will not find <CODE>run</CODE>.

<P>
[ <B><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="#toc">TOC</A></FONT></B> ]
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Order_of_Evaluation">Order of Evaluation</A></H2>
<P>
In general, the order of evaluation is not important. Internally swish-e
processes the search terms from left to right. Parenthesis can be used to
group searches together, effectively changing the order of evaluation. For
example these three are the same:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    swish-e -w foo not bar baz
    swish-e -w not bar foo baz
    swish-e -w baz foo not bar</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
but these two are <STRONG>not</STRONG> the same:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    swish-e -w foo not bar baz
    swish-e -w foo not (bar baz)</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
The first finds all documents that contain both foo and baz, but do not
contain bar. The second finds all that contain foo, and contain either bar
or baz, but not both.

<P>
It is often helpful in understanding searches to use the boolean terms and
parenthesis. So the above two become:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    swish-e -w foo AND (not bar) AND baz
    swish-e -w foo AND (not (bar AND baz))</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
These four examples are all the same search (assuming that AND is the
default search type):

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    swish-e -w 'juliet not ophelia and pac'
    swish-e -w '(juliet) AND (NOT ophelia) AND (pac)'
    swish-e -w 'juliet not ophelia pac'
    swish-e -w 'pac and juliet and not ophelia'</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
Looking at the the first three searches, first Swish-e finds all the
documents with &quot;juliet&quot;. Then it finds all documents that do not
contain &quot;ophelia&quot;. Those two lists are then combined with the
boolean AND operator resulting with a list of documents that include
&quot;juliet&quot; but not &quot;ophelia&quot;. Finally, that list is ANDed
with the list of documents that contain &quot;pac&quot; resulting.

<P>
However it is always possible to force the order of evaluation by using
parenthesis. For example:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    swish-e -w 'juliet not (ophelia and pac)'</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
retrieves files with &quot;juliet&quot; that do not contain both words
&quot;ophelia&quot; and &quot;pac&quot;.

<P>
[ <B><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="#toc">TOC</A></FONT></B> ]
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Meta_Tags">Meta Tags</A></H2>
<P>
MetaNames are used to represent <EM>fields</EM> (called <EM>columns</EM> in a database) and provide a way to search in only parts of a document. See <A HREF="././SWISH-CONFIG.html#Document_Contents_Directives">SWISH-CONFIG</A> for a description of MetaNames, and how they are specified in the source
document.

<P>
To limit a search to words found in a meta tag you prefix the keywords with
the name of the meta tag, followed by the equal sign:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    metaname = word
    metaname = (this or that)
    metaname = ( (this or that) or &quot;this phrase&quot; )</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
It is not necessary to have spaces at either side of the &quot;=&quot;,
consequently the following are equivalent:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    swish-e -w &quot;metaName=word&quot;
    swish-e -w &quot;metaName = word&quot;
    swish-e -w &quot;metaName= word&quot;</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
To search on a word that contains a &quot;=&quot;, precede the
&quot;=&quot; with a &quot;\&quot; (backslash).

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    swish-e -w &quot;test\=3 = x\=4 or y\=5&quot;</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
this query returns the files where the word &quot;x=4&quot; is associated
with the metaName &quot;test=3&quot; or that contains the word
&quot;y=5&quot; not associated with any metaName.

<P>
Queries can be also constructed using any of the usual search features,
moreover metaName and plain search can be mixed in a single query.

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>     swish-e -w &quot;metaName1 = (a1 or a4) not (a3 and a7)&quot;</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
This query will retrieve all the files in which &quot;a1&quot; or
&quot;a2&quot; are found in the META tag &quot;metaName1&quot; and that do
not contain the words &quot;a3&quot; and &quot;a7&quot;, where
&quot;a3&quot; and &quot;a7&quot; are not associated to any meta name.

<P>
[ <B><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="#toc">TOC</A></FONT></B> ]
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Phrase_Searching">Phrase Searching</A></H2>
<P>
To search for a phrase in a document use double-quotes to delimit your
search terms. (The phrase delimiter is set in src/swish.h.)

<P>
You must protect the quotes from the shell.

<P>
For example, under Unix:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    swish-e -w '&quot;this is a phrase&quot; or (this and that)'
    swish-e -w 'meta1=(&quot;this is a phrase&quot;) or (this and that)'</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
Or under Windows:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    swish-e -w \&quot;this is a phrase\&quot; or (this and that)</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
You can not use boolean search terms inside a phrase. That is:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    swish-e -w 'this and that'</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
finds documents with both words &quot;this&quot; and &quot;that&quot;, but:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    swish-e -w '&quot;this and that&quot;'</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
finds documents that have the phrase &quot;that and that&quot;. A phrase
can consist of a single word, so this is how to search for the words used
as boolean operators:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>   swish-e -w 'this &quot;and&quot; that'</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
finds documents that contain all three words, but in any order.

<P>
You can use the <CODE>-P</CODE> switch to set the phrase delimiter character. See <A HREF="././SWISH-RUN.html">SWISH-RUN</A> for examples.

<P>
[ <B><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="#toc">TOC</A></FONT></B> ]
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Context">Context</A></H2>
<P>
At times you might not want to search for a word in every part of your
files since you know that the <CODE>word(s)</CODE> are present in a
particular tag. The ability to search according to context greatly
increases the chances that your hits will be relevant, and Swish-e provides
a mechanism to do just that.

<P>
The -t option in the search command line allows you to search for words
that exist only in specific HTML tags. Each character in the string you
specify in the argument to this option represents a different tag in which
the word is searched; that is you can use any combinations of the following
characters:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    H means all&lt;HEAD&gt; tags
    B stands for &lt;BODY&gt; tags
    t is all &lt;TITLE&gt; tags
    h is &lt;H1&gt; to &lt;H6&gt; (header) tags
    e is emphasized tags (this may be &lt;B&gt;, &lt;I&gt;, &lt;EM&gt;, or &lt;STRONG&gt;)
    c is HTML comment tags (&lt;!-- ... --&gt;)</pre>

<P>
Perl ( <A HREF="http://www.perl.com/">http://www.perl.com/</A> ) is
probably the most common programming language used with Swish-e, especially
in CGI interfaces. Perl makes searching and parsing results with Swish-e
easy, but if not done properly can leave your server vulnerable to attacks.

<P>
When designing your CGI scripts you should carefully screen user input, and
include features such as paged results and a timer to limit time required
for a search to complete. These are to protect your web site against a
denial of service (DoS) attack.

<P>
Included with every distribution of Perl is a document called perlsec --
Perl Security.  <EM>Please</EM> take time to read and understand that document before writing CGI scripts
in perl.

<P>
Type at your shell/command prompt:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    perldoc perlsec</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
If nothing else, start every CGI program in perl as such:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    #!/usr/local/bin/perl -wT
    use strict;</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
That alone won't make your script secure, but may help you find insecure
code.

<P>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="CGI_Danger_">CGI Danger!</A></H2>
<P>
There are many examples of CGI scripts on the Internet. Many are poorly
written and insecure. A commonly seen way to execute Swish-e from a perl
CGI script is with a <EM>piped open</EM>. For example, it is common to see this type of <CODE>open()</CODE>:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    open(SWISH, &quot;$swish -w $query -f $index|&quot;);</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
This <CODE>open()</CODE> gives shell access to the entire Internet! Often an attempt is made to
strip <CODE>$query</CODE> of <EM>bad</EM> characters. But, this often fails since it's hard to guess what every <EM>bad</EM> character is. Would you have thought about a null? A better approach is to
only allow
<EM>in</EM> known safe characters.

<P>
Even if you can be sure that any user supplied data is safe, this
<EM>piped open</EM> still passes the command parameters through the shell. If nothing else,
it's just an extra unnecessary step to running Swish-e.

<P>
Therefore, the recommended approach is to fork and exec <CODE>swish-e</CODE> directly without passing through the shell. This process is described in
the perl man page <CODE>perlipc</CODE> under the appropriate heading <STRONG>Safe Pipe Opens</STRONG>.

If all this sounds complicated you may wish to use a Perl module that does
all the hard work for you.

<P>
The Swish-e distribution includes a Perl module called SWISH::API.
SWISH::API provides access to the Swish-e C Library.

<P>
The SWISH::API module is <EM>not</EM> installed by default.

<P>
The SWISH::API module will <EM>embed</EM> Swish-e into your perl program so that searching does not require running
an external program. Embedding the Swish-e program into your perl program
results in faster Swish-e searches, especially when running under a
persistent environment like mod_perl since it avoids the cost of opening
the index file for every request (mod_perl is much also much faster than
CGI because it avoids the need to compile Perl code for every request).

<P>
See the README file in the <EM>perl</EM> directory of the Swish-e distribution for installation instructions.
Documentation for the SWISH::API module is available at <A
HREF="http://swish-e.org">http://swish-e.org</A> and is installed along
with other HTML documentation on your computer.
