This pages is intended to give users of Swish-e an idea of the changes to
come, to foster discussion of the direction of Swish-e, and a place where
developers can map out new ideas.

<P>
None of this is written in stone. Any of the developers can write their
ideas in this document, but that doesn't mean it will actually happen ;).

<P>
The Swish-e index structure currently makes it difficult to do incremental
indexing, range limiting, and presents limits to indexing due to memory
requirements. A database may solve some of these issues, at possibly a cost
of performance.

<P>
Swish-e has been linked with Berkeley DB. Although much slower in indexing,
this may allow incremental indexing. Currently, the idea is to offer both
database backends.

<P>
UPDATE: Mon Nov 8 15:07:59 CST 2004 (<A
HREF="mailto:karman@cray.com">karman@cray.com</A>)

<P>
This feature is in the 2.5 branch already. What kind of requirements do we
have to label it 'stable'?

<P>
There may be a small benefit from creating a smaller search-only program.
CGI scripts may be faster, and the code would be smaller for those that
want to embed Swish-e in to other applications.

<P>
Currently, linking libswish-e into a program adds about 720K. Not real
significant, but it could be if a number of processes are running with
Swish-e. Another option is to build libswish-e as a shared library.

<P>
UPDATE: Mon Nov 8 15:09:12 CST 2004 (<A

This seems done in the 2.4 release. Is that true?

<P>
Moseley: Dec 28, 2000

<P>
I'm wondering if it might be smart to switch from the current
&quot;Document Types&quot; to Content-Types. Currently, Swish-e know how to
parse three types of documents TXT, HTML, and XML. There's currently two
new configuration directives DefaultContents and IndexContents that map
file extensions to one of the three types. This doesn't really work when
spidering since it's the content-type that describes the document and not
the file extension.

<P>
It's an issue that can wait, but I'm concerned about backward compatiblity
before people start using the IndexContents and DefaultContents config
directives and then we change to content-type in the future. There's
probably not that many people using those, but it might be work noting in
the documentation that it will change, if we agree.

<P>
The main reason to use content-type instead is for http processing where
you can't depend on the file extension to determine the document type, so
with http we have to use content-type to determine how to deal with the
file. This is somewhat moot, as mapping can now be done with -S prog.

<P>
I'd propose that Swish-e uses a mime.types file to map from extension to
content-type. You could add or override mappings in the config file:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>   AddType text/plain .doc .log</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>   DefaultType text/html  # like DefaultContents currently</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
The file source &quot;plug-in&quot; (whatever that ends up being) would
return a content-type, but if not returned then Swish-e would map the type
from the file name using the mime.types file or any AddType directives.

<P>
Again, internally Swish-e only knows about text/[TXT|HTML|XML], so there
should be a way to map other types, otherwise Swish-e might ignore the
file. We could continue to use the three type names or switch completely to
content-types.

<P>
For example, if we continued to use [TXT|HTML|XML]

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    MapType TXT  text/directory text/logfile
    MapType HTML text/html</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
Or maybe just extend the current directives

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    IndexContents HTML .htm .html text/html</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
Where the content-type would have precedence over the file extensions.    

<P>
This would tell Swish-e that those types are handled by those internal
handlers.

<P>
Then as I've mentioned before, you might specify filters as such

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>   FilterDocument application/msword /path/to/word-to-text</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
And word-to-text would convert to text and return one of the three
content-types that Swish-e knows how to parse, or a different content type
if were to chain filters.

<H1><A NAME="Enhanced_the_PropertyNames_directive">Enhanced the PropertyNames directive</A></H1>
<P>
Moseley: Updated Jan 13, 2001

<P>
If the PropertyNames directive was enhanced to be able to limit the number
of characters stored, optionally extract text from HTML, and was able to
define what type of docs (text, XML, HTML) it applied to, then the existing
PropertyNames feature would work like the new StoreDescription feature but
be useful for more than just one use.

<P>
I'm not clear how to enhance the syntax of Properties and/or Metanames, but
here's some ideas. Rainer suggested that an xml-type of format might be
best and commonly understood. That's a good idea. Below are some older
ideas that I had. But you will get the idea...

<P>
The metaname structure could have flags for properties:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    1 - limiting to a length
    2 - stripping HTML
    3 - encoding HTML entities on output</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
Oct 9, 2001 - The code is now in Swish-e to limit a string property to a
length. The stripping of HTML is an issue for discussion. And encoding
entities on output should be a result_outpu.c issue.

<P>
UPDATE: Mon Nov 8 15:13:26 CST 2004 (<A
HREF="mailto:karman@cray.com">karman@cray.com</A>)

<P>
Is this fully supported in 2.4?

<H1><A NAME="Apache_XML_style_configuration">Apache/XML style configuration</A></H1>
<P>
This would be to allow some directives to be set per directory, or perl
file extenstion (or content-type).
