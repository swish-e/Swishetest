<P>
If you are upgrading Swish-e, please review the CHANGES file before
installation. The index format may change and existing indexes may need to
be re-created before use.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="What_is_Swish_e_">What is Swish-e?</A></H1>
<P>
Swish-e is <STRONG>S</STRONG>imple <STRONG>W</STRONG>eb <STRONG>I</STRONG>ndexing <STRONG>S</STRONG>ystem for <STRONG>H</STRONG>umans - <STRONG>E</STRONG>nhanced. Swish-e can quickly and easily index directories of files or
remote web sites and search the generated indexes.

<P>
Swish-e is extremely fast in both indexing and searching, highly
configurable, and can be seamlessly integrated with existing web sites to
maintain a consistent design. Swish-e can index web pages, but can just as
easily index text files, mailing list archives, or data stored in a
relational database.

<P>
Swish is designed to index small- to medium-sized collection of documents,
Although a few users are indexing over a million documents, typical usage
is more often in the tens of thousands. Currently, Swish-e only indexes
eight bit character encodings.

<P>
Swish-e version 2.2 was a major rewrite of the code and the addition of
many new features. Memory requirements for indexing have been reduced and
indexing speed is significantly improved from previous versions. New
features allow more control over indexing, better document parsing,
improved indexing and searching logic, better filter code, and the ability
to index from any data source.

<P>
Swish-e version 2.4 includes a major rewrite of the C API and a new Perl
module for accessing the Swish-e C library. In addition, Swish-e 2.4 uses
the GNU Auto Tools. The significant changes are where files are installed,
and the use of Libtool to create the Swish-e library as a shared library on
many platforms. Basically, installation is easier than previous versions,
and more files are installed in &quot;standard&quot; locations (e.g.
documentation is installed in <CODE>$prefix/share/doc/swish-e</CODE>).

<P>
Note: Due to the new build and installation system in Swish-e 2.4, some
documentation may incorrectly list the location of files. Please report any
documentation errors to the Swish-e Discussion list.

<P>
Swish-e is not a &quot;turn-key&quot; indexing and searching solution. The
Swish-e distribution contains most of the parts to create such a system,
but you need to put the parts together as best meets your needs. This gives
you the power to index and search your documents the way you wish and to
seamlessly integrate a search engine into your web site or application.

<P>
To use Swish-e, you will need to configure Swish-e to index your documents,
create an index by running Swish-e, and setup an interface such as a CGI
script (a script is included) to search the index and display results.
Swish uses helper programs to index documents of types that Swish-e cannot
natively index. These programs may need to be installed separately from
Swish-e.

<P>
Swish-e is an Open Source (see: <A
HREF="http://opensource.org">http://opensource.org</A> ) program supported
by developers and a large group of users. Please take time to join the
Swish-e discussion list at <A
HREF="http://Swish-e.org">http://Swish-e.org</A> .

<P>
Read the <A HREF="././INSTALL.html">INSTALL</A> page.

<P>
Building from source is recommended. On most platforms, Swish-e should
build without problems. A list of platforms where Swish-e has been built
can be found in the <A HREF="././INSTALL.html">INSTALL</A> page. Information on building for VMS and Win32 can be found in
sub-directories of the <CODE>src</CODE> directory. Check the Swish-e site for information about binary
distributions (such as for Windows).

<P>
In addition to the INSTALL page, make sure you read the <A HREF="././SWISH-FAQ.html">SWISH-FAQ</A> page if you have any questions, or to get an idea of questions that you
might someday ask.

<P>
Problems or questions about installing Swish-e should be directed to the
Swish-e discussion list (see the Swish-e web site at <A
HREF="http://Swish-e.org">http://Swish-e.org</A>).

<P>

<P>
Documentation is provided as HTML pages installed in
$prefix/share/doc/swish-e where <CODE>$prefix</CODE> is /usr/local if
building from source, or /usr if installed as part of a package from your
OS vendor. Under Windows <CODE>$prefix</CODE> is selected at installation
time.

<P>
A subset of the documentation is installed as system man pages as well.

<P>
Documentation is also available on-line at <A
HREF="http://swish-e.org.">http://swish-e.org.</A>

<P>
If your system includes the required support files and programs, the
distribution make files can also generate the documentation in these
formats:

<P>
SWISH was created by Kevin Hughes, circa 1994, to fill the need of the
growing number of Web administrators on the Internet - many of the indexing
systems were not well documented, were hard to use and install, and were
too complex for their own good. The system was widely used for several
years, long enough to collect some bug fixes and requests for enhancements.

<P>
In Fall 1996, The Library of UC Berkeley received permission from Kevin
Hughes to implement bug fixes and enhancements to the original binary. The
result is Swish-enhanced or Swish-e, brought to you by the Swish-e
Development Team.
