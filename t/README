# Explanation of file naming in Swishetest/t :

# many testfiles are named like;
#  test number - collection number used - subject - filetype .t
#
# IE, 
#
#    014-C014-communication-html.t             # test 14, html files about 'communication'
#    015-C014-communication-stemming-html.t    # test 15, same but with stemming enabled
#
# other testfiles are obviously more traditionally named.
